# Around Us

The idea behind this prototype is to create a news-sharing application around the users' place. It has a login and register view, home view to show the news from the other users, post view to record the news, put some description and category, and profile view to show our account and posts that we have ever posted before.

This prototype is created with xcode 8 and Swift 3 but still in a messy code and still in development to store the news data in database.

This app could access the camera and record a video, put some description and store these data inside the local core data, access the photo library and a custom dropdown picker.
